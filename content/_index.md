              Major Accomplishments:
              * Collaborated on a spacecraft orbit propagation software tool in C++ with less than 30m/day error growth by simulating perturbations from multiple sources with adaptive time stepping integration.
              * Integrated CSPICE package for planetary ephemeris, increasing accuracy to over 99.9% as compared to NASA’s GMAT.
              * Collaborated with a cross-functional team in realization of a Mach 6-capable Dynamic Damping test setup.
              * Validated system performance, by reproducing result from open literature with over 99% accuracy in damping data.
              * Delivered a vision-based attitude measurement software package in Python with resolution <0.05 deg.
              * Designed and implemented a pneumatic actuator and control system, enabling angular excitation up to 30 deg.

              Topic –“Strut based injection strategies for Scramjet with emphasis on impinging jet”

              Performed experimental investigations on the effect of impinging jets on the mixing behavior. Carried out experiments in Mach 1.7 Open Jet facility at Advanced Propulsion and Laser Diagnostics lab at IIST. 

              * Designed and fabricated strut with different impingement angles using Solidworks.
              * Devised a scheme for optimum seeding required to achieve efficient Mie scattering.
              * Programmed a LabView code to run the open jet facility, taking into consideration valve operations, camera trigger, laser trigger and secondary flow injection.
              * Developed an image processing based MATLAB code for calculation of mixing area using the Mie scattering images and further post processing of the data.
