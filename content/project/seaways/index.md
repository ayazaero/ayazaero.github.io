As a key contributor to the BlackBoat project starting in September 2021, I was involved in an effort to refine control algorithms for autonomous marine vehicles. Our primary focus was to create a specialized pump-jet boat test-bed using innovative design and 3D printing techniques.

A notable feat within our project involved establishing sophisticated remote control mechanisms rather than employing conventional manual control methods. This concealed aspect of our project played a crucial role in developing and refining remote control capabilities for the boat. By utilizing advanced remote control systems, we ensured the boat's precision in maintaining a consistent straight-line trajectory, even amidst challenging water currents. Remarkably, the boat showcased minimal deviation, remaining within 1 meter of the desired path while traversing at speeds exceeding 15 kilometers per hour.

A critical aspect that ensured the project's success was our strategic use of a specialized adhesive-based surface treatment. This treatment served as a protective measure for the boat's electronic components, mitigating the risk of potential water leakage. Implementing this precautionary step was essential to ensure the durability and optimal functionality of the onboard electronics, particularly in varying water conditions.

The amalgamation of cutting-edge technology, meticulous control algorithms, and precise engineering techniques marked a significant achievement in the BlackBoat project. These advancements not only refined control mechanisms for autonomous marine vehicles but also hinted at potential enhancements in maritime navigation across diverse scenarios.

My involvement in this project provided valuable insights into advancing autonomous marine systems. The accomplishments of the BlackBoat project lay a foundation for further innovations in the field, promising increased efficiency and reliability in autonomous marine systems. This experience solidified my belief in the continuous evolution of technology in maritime navigation, paving the way for future breakthroughs in autonomous vessel control.
