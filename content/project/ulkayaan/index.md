title: Ulkayaan â€“ A Rendezvous and Landing mission to Comet 46P/Wirtanen.
summary: Conceptualized a rendezvous and landing mission to comet 46P/Wirtanen. Preliminary trajectory designed using methods of Hohmann transfer and Lambert conics. Landing approach designed through successively shrinking triangular orbits, followed by semi-circular arcs and a terminator circular orbit. Carried out spacecraft system integration, allocating space for necessary payloads and subsystems.
